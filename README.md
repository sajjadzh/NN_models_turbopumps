This repository contains the neural network models for the prediction of tip clearance effects on the performance of radial turbopumps.
Each model can be opened in Julia programing language or MATLAB. Each model is saved in .jld2 and .mat formats for Julia programing language and MATLAB, respectively. Upon reading each model in the appropriate language environment, it can be used to predict the head loss coefficient or the slip factor through the relationships presented in the paper.
